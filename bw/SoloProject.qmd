For my solo project, I wanted to visualize the shifts in Democratic voteshare across Minnesotaâ€™s eight congressional districts between the 2022 midterm elections and the 2024 general election. This project involved collecting certified election results from both cycles, calculating the change in Democratic voteshare, and displaying those shifts through a comparative visual format.

# Reflection: 

The map offers several insightful observations about the shifts in Democratic voteshare between the 2022 midterm elections and the 2024 elections. Notably, Minnesota's 2nd Congressional District experienced a significant shift in favor of Democratic candidate Angie Craig. This district has long been considered a swing district, but in 2024, Craig secured a commanding victory, greatly surpassing her 2022 performance and outperforming other Democrats in the state. Additionally, while Minnesota's 7th District remains a heavily Republican area, it did shift slightly to the left. Most other districts showed moderate shifts to the right, consistent with national trends. Interestingly, Minnesota's 5th District, the most Democratic in the state, showed no change between the two election cycles.

These shifts provide valuable insights into where Democratic candidates gained or lost support in 2024 and open the door to several important research questions. What campaign strategies, narratives, or tactics did certain candidates employ that may have contributed to their increased support? What role did money play in the outcome? These are all compelling questions that warrant further exploration by political scientists and data scientists alike.
