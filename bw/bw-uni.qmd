Use this file to generate a professional looking **univariate** visualization. The visualization will not perfect the first time but you are expected to improve on it throughout the semester especially after covering advanced topics such as effective viz.

### UNIVARIATE VIZUALIZATION ###

# Import Data 
hikes <- read.csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/high_peaks.csv")

# Download Tidyverse
library(tidyverse)

# Create Univariate Visualization with improvements
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +
  geom_bar(color = "steelblue", fill = "skyblue", width = 0.8) +   # Adjust colors and width
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of Hike Ratings",                        # Add title
    x = "Hike Rating",                                             # Label x-axis
    y = "Frequency of Hikes") +                                    # Label y-axis
  theme_minimal() +                                                # Clean background
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold"))                  # Make the title bold
```
