Use this file to generate a professional looking **univariate** visualization. The visualization will not perfect the first time but you are expected to improve on it throughout the semester especially after covering advanced topics such as effective viz.

### UNIVARIATE VIZUALIZATION ###

# Import Data 
hikes <- read.csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/high_peaks.csv")

# Download Tidyverse
library(tidyverse)

#Reorder Rating
hikes$rating <- factor(hikes$rating, levels = c("easy", "moderate", "difficult"))

# Create Univariate Visualization with improvements
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +
  geom_bar(color = "darkblue", fill = "skyblue", width = 0.8) +              # Adjust colors and width
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of Hike Ratings",                                   # Add title
    x = "Hike Rating",                                                        # Label x-axis
    y = "Frequency of Hikes",                                                 # Label y-axis
    caption = "Source: Serhiy Mytrovtsiy, 2020") +                            # Add source info
  theme_minimal() +                                                           # Clean background
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", size = 15, hjust = 0.5),     # Make the title bold
        plot.caption = element_text(size = 10),                               # Adjust size of  caption 
        panel.grid.major = element_line(color = "gray80"))                    # Adjust grid lines
